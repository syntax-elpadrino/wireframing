# Wireframing

## Introduction
**Wireframing** is the process of creating a visual blueprint or skeleton of a user interface (UI).  
It outlines the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a digital product (such as a website or mobile app) before detailed design and development begin.
Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with a product, ensuring that the layout supports usability and user goals.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
- **Clarifies structure and functionality:** Helps define how different elements and pages connect.  
- **Improves communication:** Serves as a visual tool to discuss ideas and feedback among team members and clients.  
- **Saves time and resources:** Identifies usability issues early, before full design or coding begins.  
- **Guides the design process:** Acts as a foundation for creating mockups, prototypes, and final UI designs.
